                Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a style sheet language initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2016. After its initial versions, Weizenbaum and Chris Eppstein continued to extend Sass with SassScript, a simple scripting language used in Sass files.<br><br>
                It is a CSS pre-processor. It is an extension of CSS that is used to add power and elegance to the basic language. It facilitates you to add variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, inheritance and more, all with fully CSS-compatible syntax.<br><br>
                Sass was initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006. After the initial development, Natalie Weizenbaum and Chris Eppstein continue with its initial version and extend Sass with SassScript, a simple scripting language used in Sass files.<br><br>
                Sass was first created in 2006 using Ruby. However, this version of Sass was deprecated and reached end-of-life in 2019. You shouldn’t use this version of Sass anymore.
                The main version of Sass currently is called Dart Sass. As the name implies, this version was created using Dart. Version 1.0.0 of Dart Sass was released in March 2018. Dart Sass is the version you’ll likely want to use when starting a new project.<br><br>
                Normally, the difference between SASS and CSS is truly understood by expert web designers. Since it is explained in the SASS introduction that it is an acronym for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets.A developer should understand what is transpilation. Usually, the code files cannot be employed directly in web designing, just like CSS stylesheets.

                Sass facilitates you to write clean, easy and less CSS in a programming construct. It contains fewer codes so you can write CSS quicker. It is more stable, powerful, and elegant because it is an extension of CSS. So, it is easy for designers and developers to work more efficiently and quickly.<br><br>
                Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a CSS pre-processor can help.
                Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff.<br><br>

                    It is compatible with all versions of CSS. So, you can use any available CSS libraries.<br>
                    It provides nesting so you can use nested syntax and useful functions like color manipulation, math functions and other values.<br>
                    Using Sass may cause of losing benefits of browser's built-in element inspector.<br>
