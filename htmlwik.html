                The first version of HTML was written by <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999.
                
                Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML is a standard markup language that is used to create other markup languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Since each of these languages was written in a common language (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications. This makes XML potentially very powerful, and it's no surprise that the W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML). XHTML became an official standard in 2000, and was updated in 2002. XHTML is very similar to HTML, but has stricter rules. Strict rules are necessary for all XML languages, because without it, interoperability between applications would be impossible. You'll learn more about the differences between HTML and XHTML in Unit 2.<br>
                <center>1991- Tim Berners-Lee invents HTML 1.0<br>
                    1993- HTML 1.0 is released. Not many developers are creating websites at this time.<br>
                    1995- HTML 2.0 is published. This contains the features of HTML 1.0 plus new features.<br> This remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until 1997.<br>
                    1997- HTML 3.0 was invented. Here, Dave Raggett introduced a fresh draft on HTML,<br> which improved new features of HTML and gave more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing websites.<br> Unfortunately, the powerful features slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.<br>
                    1999- The widely-used HTML 4.0 comes out. It is very successful.<br>
                    2014- HTML 5.0 is released and used worldwide.<br> It is said to be the extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in 2012.<br></center>

                <center><h3>What is HTML?</h3></center>HTML is a Hyper-Text Markup Language that is used for developing web pages on the internet and In short we can say that It is the language of the World Wide Web.

When you find something on the internet by searching on the browser that time you see there are too many results is there, they all results are combined in the form of a website which is built with an HTML language and even right now you reading this blog is also a part of HTML file.
                <center><h3>Importance Of HTML</h3></center>HTML is the backbone of web pages or sites. let assume your body has no bones then what will you do, how you can do your work? If your body has no bones then you are nothing, you can’t do anything. That’s how HTML is Important to web pages or sites. Without HTML web pages or sites can’t be created, if there are no websites that mean no web browser, and no web applications. That’s the importance of HTML.<br>
                Here are the basic points for understanding the importance of HTML:<br>

                <b>**</b> HTML is used for creating a web page and designing a web page.<br>
                <b>**</b> It also helps to view the web pages in the browser. This is because due to HTML, the web page content was received by the web browser in the form of an HTML file.<br>
                <b>**</b> With the help of HTML elements and tags we can write a blog in a proper manner by using  tags,s, etc., and also embed images, video, CSS, javascript, etc in it.
