                CSS was created by <b>HÃ¥kon Wium Lie</b> to allow web designers to change the layout, colors, and fonts of their websites. Originally, websites were meant to be used by researchers only, so the decoration did not matter. However, when websites became widespread, the need to make them look nice grew.<br>
                <center>**1994- HÃ¥kon Wium Lie proposed the idea of CSS.<br>
                **1996- The first version of CSS was invented.<br>
                **1998- CSS 2 was released and work on CSS 3 began.<br> CSS 3 was very different from the other versions, fot instead of being a single monolithic specification,<br> it was published as a set of separate documents known as modules.<br> Each module dealt with a relatively small subset of the overall specification,<br> and either added new features or refined and extended existing features.<br> All additions and enhancements to the specification were written in order to be backward-compatible with older versions of CSS.<br>
                **2011- CSS 2.1 was released, which fixed the errors found in CSS 2<br></center>
                Along with HTML, CSS is also standardized by W3C that controls the web standards. CSS is free to use, independent and it is also an open-source standard. And users can use HTML and CSS together with the W3C.
                If we look at the history of CSS, we will find it has seen mainly three updates. CSS level 1 was launched in 1996, and it came again in 1999 with some improvements. However, CSS level 2 or CSS2 came in 1998 with media support. In this version, the user can utilize the other media elements. And finally, its latest version, CSS level 3, launched, and currently, we use this version only. The latest version of CSS allows us to take advantage of separation that helps in saving time.
                If you need to make some critical changes on a large website with hundreds of pages. Currently, CSS comes with over 60 modules with different features. In recent years, most developers and designers have tried a variety of browsers to see the effects of CSS on web pages. But most of them found Firefox as the most helpful for the same concern.

                <center><b><h3>What Is CSS</h3></b></center>
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the coding language that gives a website its look and layout. Along with HTML, CSS is fundamental to web design. Without it, websites would still be plain text on white backgrounds.
                Before the development of CSS in 1996 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Web pages were extremely limited in both form and function. Early browsers presented a page as hypertext - plain text, images and links to other hypertext pages. There was no layout at all to speak of, merely paragraphs running across the page in a single column
                They put the "style" in style sheets, and for the first time, Web pages could be designed.
                <center><h3><b>Importance Of CSS</b></h3></center>
                Cascading Style Sheets, commonly known as CSS, is an integral part of the modern web development process. It is a highly effective HTML tool that provides easy control over layout and presentation of website pages by separating content from design.
                Although CSS was introduced in 1996, it gained mainstream popularity by the early 2000s when popular browsers started supporting its advanced features. The latest version, CSS3, has been available since 1998 and was last updated in September 2008.<br>
                CSS works by creating rules. These rules are simultaneously applied to multiple elements within the site. Eliminating the repetitive coding style of HTML makes development work faster and less monotonous. Errors are also reduced considerably.
                Since the content is completely separated from the design, changes across the website can be implemented all at once. This reduces delivery times and costs of future edits.<br>
                Improved website loading is an underrated yet important benefit of CSS. Browsers download the CSS rules once and cache them for loading all the pages of a website. It makes browsing the website faster and enhances the overall user experience.
