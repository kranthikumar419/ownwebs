                JavaScript was invented by <b>Brendan Eich</b> in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser.

                After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5)
                Adobe, Mozilla, Opera, and Google who wanted a massive ES4 upgrade.<br>

                August 13 2008, Brendan Eich wrote an email:<br>
                
                It's no secret that the JavaScript standards body, Ecma's Technical Committee 39, has been split for over a year, with some members favoring ES4, a major fourth edition to ECMA-262, and others advocating ES3.1 based on the existing ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ES3) specification. Now, I'm happy to report, the split is over.

                In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.<br>
                Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)<br>
                Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)<br>
                Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)<br>
                Dates are always objects<br>
                Maths are always objects<br>
                Regular expressions are always objects<br>
                Arrays are always objects<br>
                Functions are always objects<br>
                Objects are always objects<br>

                <center><h3>What is JS?</h3></center>
                JavaScript is a programming language used primarily by Web browsers to create a dynamic and interactive experience for the user. Most of the functions and applications that make the Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of JavaScript.<br><br>
                The earliest incarnations of JavaScript were developed in the late 1990s for the Netscape Navigator Web browser. At the time, Web pages were static, offering little user interaction beyond clicking links and loading new pages. For the first time, JavaScript enabled animation, adaptive content and form validation on the page.<br><br>
                JavaScript did not become standardized and widely adopted until 1999. Even after standardization, browser compatibility remained an issue for over a decade.


                <center><h3>Importance Of JS</h3></center>
                JavaScript is a light-weight object-oriented programming language that is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language. JavaScript enables dynamic interactivity on websites when it is applied to an HTML document.<br><br>
                JavaScript helps the users to build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. JavaScript is commonly used to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface by the DOM API. It is mainly used in web applications.<br><br>
                As day-by-day there is a continuous improvement in the browsers, so JavaScript gained popularity for making robust web applications. We can understand it by taking the example of Google Maps. In Maps user just requires to click and drag the mouse; the details are visible just by a click.
