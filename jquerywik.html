                Back in 2006, <b>John Resig</b> was a web developer working on his own projects. He was frustrated with how hard it was to write cross-browser JavaScript, and decided to write his own JS library to fix the problem for him: jQuery.jQuery was first released in January 2006 by John Resig at BarCamp NYC. It is currently headed by Timmy Wilson and maintained by a team of developers.

                Nowadays, jQuery is widely used technology. Most of the websites are using jQuery.<br><br>
                There were two main goals of the library; the first goal of jQuery was to provide an ergonomic API that can be used to manipulate a webpage. This provided coders with an extremely powerful way to select elements. The best part about the library was that it was not limited to selecting elements based on their classes and IDs but could also be used for complex expressions. For instance, you could use jQuery to select elements based on their relationship with other elements. 

                the second goal that the library achieved is that it absorbed the differences between browsers, as back then, it was extremely difficult to have codes that worked flawlessly on all browsers. <br><br>
                The lack of standardized code made the developer’s life incredibly hard as they encountered different edge cases and browser behavior. Later on, the library made more sophisticated techniques easy to adopt, techniques like Ajax and animations. Knowing the right time to use jQuery is extremely crucial. If you are dealing with a project that will grow in complexity, then it is not recommended to use jQuery. 

                A project can be considered complex when you want to break the UI into different components, and there are better frameworks than jQuery that can help you do that. <br><br>
                This is mainly because, at first, things might look easy, but later on, you will end up with a spaghetti code in which you won’t be sure which part of the code affects which part of the webpage. 

                Now, if you are wondering if jQuery would be best for small web pages with little to no dynamic content, you might want to reconsider that thought. Thanks to the native APIs, now you can say goodbye to jQuery for small webpages as well. Now let’s not be hopeless and think that jQuery is entirely useless to use today. There are certain areas where this JavaScript library would work best at. The library provides comprehensive functionality for powering the front end of a website.

                jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.<br><br>
                jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

                <b>JQuery</b> : It is a compact, swift and feature rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that runs across large number of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, JQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

                In other words, JavaScript is presented in a simplified form because of JQuery. It is rather comfortable to read.

                Before beginning about the importance and Advantages of JQuery it is the foremost important thing to know what exactly JQuery is all about.<br><br>
